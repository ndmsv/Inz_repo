The project is a combination of React, .net 8 and MySQL. 

MySQL db is contained in backend/database.

To start a project, after you download it you need to go to folder you installed it and
- if you previously installed .net 8 go to yourDirectory/backend in cmd and run "dotnet run"
- if you previously installed react, go to yourDirectiry/frontend in cmd and run "npm start"

I use Visual Studio for bachend project and VS Code for frontend project.
If you want to do the same, make sure to install past 2023 realease Visual Studio version (I work on Version 17.9.4), since .net 8 is a fresh thing the moment I am writing this.
